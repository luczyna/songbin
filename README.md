# Songbin

_This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0._

SongBin is an app to store youtube videos to learn from. Portions of the video timeline can be played on command when only a section needs to be reviewed, and can be replayed on loop to help with memorisation.

This app is originally made to help with learning a musical instrument, and collecting songs to learn. You should be able to separate different stanzas of songs, using Songbin to help you learn to play sections at a time. Songbin can be also used to learn other languages, where listening to songs or other speaking can help with memorisation of phrases, words, and intonation.

### Development server
